Timing overhead is warmed up for 1000000 iterations
Then timing overhead is looped for a half second (its normally around 22-23ns)

The selected function warms up for 1000000 iterations
Then the function is looped for a half second
The average time in nanoseconds is then calculated and the timing overhead is subtracted
